# Adam

## Song Facts
* Claims he does the most damage

## Tone
Matter-of-fact and official sounding. Arrogant and proud. Shows great concern
for friends underneath his annoying bravado.


# Turk

## Desire to be head
A "guaranteed" television pilot that he starred in was passed up by every
major studio. Despite Turk's appearance of fame and fortune, he could actually
default on his properties and loans due to mismanagement of funds without a
steady job. He wants to increase his brand and image by acting as the head in the
hopes of scoring more gigs to bring his life stability.

## Tone
Cursing and easy word play. Sucker for buzzwords and pop culture. Can get real
under extreme circumstances, but tends to hide behind fame instead of dealing
with his shit.

## Song Facts
* Has an agent
* Is a star of some sort
  * Movies?
  * Television?

## Contrived Facts
*  


# Hank

## Song Facts
* NASA trained
* Fought against MegaMoth
* Calls "Adam" the "Golden Boy"

## Desire to be head
Wants to be appreciated by others and wants to recognized for his intelligence
and talents. But this is compensating for the fact that he just wants acceptance
from his crew, but more importantly, his family. Growing up in the Greenmount
East neighborhood of Baltimore, his family are staunchly religious and
unaccepting of his queerness. He's hoping that being the head will compensate
for this or perhaps give him the courage to be honest.

## Tone
Sweet inside, but sometimes posters to be accepted by folks.
Uses a well-defined vocabulary, but sometimes to the point of presumption.
